[Syphon](http://syphon.v002.info/) is currently only compatible with OS X and clients are available for large number of applications and development environments ranging from Processing to Max to openFrameworks.

#Basic Usage

The easiest way to get started is to download the [latest executable](https://github.com/bakercp/IPCAM2SYPHON/downloads) and unzip it to your desired location.  Make sure that the `bin/` directory is next to the app.  The `bin/` directory where the program finds your configuration files.

You will find several test configuration files ending with `.xml`.  __IPCAM2SYPHON__ will open `streams.xml`.

Once you open up your streams, you can connect to them using the Syphon client of your choice.  

For optimal speed, you can disable previews on the __IPCAM2SYPHON__ app.  Key controls include:

* Arrow keys select a video source
* (spacebar) toggles preview on the selected video source
* '[' disables all previews
* ']' enables all previews
* 'E' toggles screen rendering
* 's' toggles stream statistics

If you encounter problems, use `/Applications/Utilities/Console.app` to check the log files.  You will likely get some hints there.  Otherwise, please feel free to post an issue to this repository.
